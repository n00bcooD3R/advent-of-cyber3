<b><p align="left">Read the premise above, start the attached Windows analysis machine, and find the transcription logs in the <code>SantasLaptopLogs</code> folder on the Desktop.<p></b>
<p>If you want to login to the machine manually via RDP, the credentials are Administrator as the username, and grinch123! as the password.</p>

No answer needed.

<p>Each transcription log is a simple plain text file that you can open in any editor of your choice. While the filenames are random, you can get an idea as to which log "comes first" by looking at the Date Modified or Date Created attributes, or the timestamps just before the file extension!</p>
<p>Open the first transcription log. You can see the commands and output for everything that ran within PowerShell, like <code>whoami</code> and <code>systeminfo!</code> </p>
